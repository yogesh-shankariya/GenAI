**Performance snapshot**

* **Doc Metadata pipeline modernisation:** Replaced the Java Kafka-topic flow with an AWS SQS–based messaging pipeline, simplifying the system to a Python-only solution and improving scalability.

* **Observability and logging:** Implemented structured logging so that application logs, metrics, and traces are clearly surfaced in Splunk and Datadog, providing better visibility and easier troubleshooting.

* **TMV chatbot delivery:** Led the TMV chatbot data update for the new MCID, coordinating with Deepak and Akhil and delivering the changes on an accelerated timeline.

* **Config and deployment hygiene:** Parameterised all configuration variables in the deploy repo (removing hard-coded values from the code), enabling faster changes and better visibility and control of environment parameters.
