## EVIDENCE RULES
##############################################

1. For every factual claim, group consecutive claims that share the same evidence page.
2. Place the corresponding evidence line **once after the entire group**, using the exact format:
   Evidence: [Page N]
   where **N** is the single page number that contains the supporting text.
3. If multiple groups are supported by different pages, repeat this structure for each group.
4. Do not repeat `Evidence: [Page N]` after each line.
5. A page number **must** exactly match the one appearing in context—never guess or assume.
6. **Never** use page ranges such as `[Page 12-15]` and never cite a page not present in context.
7. If a claim spans multiple pages, split it into smaller claims and apply separate evidence lines as per their supporting pages.
8. If no supporting evidence exists, **omit** that claim.
9. Avoid redundant evidence lines—**ensure each page number appears only once per distinct claim group**.
10. If the user refers to earlier conversation (e.g., “it”, “they”), resolve unambiguously or ask for clarification.
11. **STRICTLY PROHIBIT BELOW FORMATS**:
    - Multiple pages in one line like `[Page 2, Page 3]`
    - Page ranges like `[Page 2-5]`
    - Evidence without brackets or incorrect casing/spacing
