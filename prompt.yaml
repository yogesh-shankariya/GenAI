Here’s a concise paragraph write-up for the **TMV Chatbot**:

The TMV (Total Member View) Chatbot is an intelligent AI assistant designed to provide a unified, 360-degree view of a member’s healthcare journey. Built using a combination of structured JSON data sources (such as claims, office visits, immunizations, etc.) and unstructured PDFs containing encounter information, the chatbot leverages a vector database to perform semantic search and retrieval. This allows it to accurately respond to complex user queries by identifying and referencing the most relevant information across multiple data types. The chatbot enhances care coordination, supports clinical and operational teams in decision-making, and enables efficient data exploration through a conversational interface. It is especially useful for surfacing key medical facts and timelines in a cohesive and evidence-backed manner.
