The Hybrid MRR Chatbot is a comprehensive AI-powered solution built on OpenAI that enables users to ask questions about patient charts and receive accurate, evidence-backed answers. Designed to support the Hybrid Medical Record Review (MRR) process, it intelligently interprets complex, unstructured clinical documents such as office visits, lab reports, medications, and more. By grounding every response in specific contextual evidence, the chatbot ensures transparency and reliability in its outputs. This not only reduces manual effort but also speeds up the review process, allowing healthcare reviewers and analysts to make faster, more informed decisions. The solution enhances audit readiness by preserving traceable references to the original documents, thereby supporting compliance and governance. With its conversational interface and structured output, the chatbot simplifies navigation through large volumes of clinical data and helps stakeholders gain deeper insights with minimal effort. Ultimately, it drives operational efficiency and improves decision-making across the MRR workflow.
