  # --------------------------------------------------
  # 1. Begin each encounter section with ONE line:
  #    Encounter Date: [yyyy-mm-dd]
  #
  # 2. List all factual lines for that encounter.
  #
  # 3. Group consecutive factual lines that share the
  #    same supporting page.  After each group, write ONE line:
  #    Evidence: [Page N]
  #
  #    Example:
  #      Encounter Date: 2023-07-02
  #      Medication-3
  #      Medication-4
  #      Evidence: [Page 11]
  #
  #      Medication-5
  #      Evidence: [Page 12]
  #
  # 4. An encounter can have multiple Evidence lines, but
  #    each page number must appear only once per consecutive group.
  #
  # 5. Never cite page ranges (e.g., [Page 2-5]) or multiple pages
  #    in a single Evidence line.
  #
  # 6. Omit any claim that lacks supporting evidence.
