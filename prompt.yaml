goal: >
  Given ONE page of clinical text, decide for each of the nine Skilled Nursing
  steps whether it is TRUE or FALSE on THIS PAGE ONLY. For every step, also
  return verbatim evidence snippet(s) from the page and a short reason.

inputs:
  page_text: "{{page_text}}"

general_rules: |
  - Use only the provided page_text; do not rely on outside knowledge or other pages.
  - A step is TRUE only if the page contains evidence that satisfies the step’s TRUE logic
    AND nothing on the page triggers that step’s FALSE logic.
  - If evidence is ambiguous or absent, set the step to FALSE.
  - Quote evidence verbatim (≤ 40 words per quote). Use 1–3 snippets max.
  - If no evidence exists, use evidence: [] and reason: "no supporting text on this page".
  - “Final Decision” is computed from the booleans of the first eight steps using
    the approval rule below; cite the combination as the reason.
  - Output booleans must be lowercase true/false.

expected_order:
  - Need for Skilled Nursing Care (General Requirement)
  - Meets Medicare 'Intermittent/Part-time' Definition
  - Observation & Assessment Need (§40.1.2.1)
  - Teaching & Training Need (§40.1.2.3)
  - Medication Administration Need (§40.1.2.4A)
  - Catheter Care Need (§40.1.2.7)
  - Wound Care Need (§40.1.2.8)
  - Ostomy Care Need (§40.1.2.9)
  - Final Decision

steps_definitions:
  - name: "Need for Skilled Nursing Care (General Requirement)"
    true_when: >
      Documentation explicitly states that the ordered home-health task(s) require the
      professional skills/judgment/knowledge of a licensed nurse and cannot be performed
      safely/effectively by the patient or an unskilled caregiver even after instruction.
    false_when: >
      Notes say the task(s) can be performed by patient/caregiver, or the record is
      silent/unclear about the need for skilled nursing.
  - name: "Meets Medicare 'Intermittent/Part-time' Definition"
    true_when: >
      ANY of: (A) SN visits are less than daily; OR (B) daily but < 21 days; OR (C)
      SN orders specifically for Foley care or daily insulin; OR (D) combined SN + HHA
      services are < 8 hours/day AND ~28 hours/week (≤35 h/week if justified); OR (E)
      predictable recurring need for ≥1 SN visit every 60 days.
    false_when: >
      Services exceed 8 h/day or 35 h/week on a continuing basis, OR no predictable
      need at least every 60 days, OR the pattern represents essentially full-time/
      continuous nursing.
  - name: "Observation & Assessment Need (§40.1.2.1)"
    true_when: >
      Skilled observation/assessment is reasonable and necessary due to abnormal,
      unstable, or fluctuating condition(s) with reasonable potential for change or
      complication; nursing assessment expected to lead to treatment modification.
      ROC (resumption of care) indicators also qualify.
    false_when: >
      Condition is stable/long-standing with no reasonable potential for change, or
      documentation does not link skilled monitoring to potential treatment modification.
  - name: "Teaching & Training Need (§40.1.2.3)"
    true_when: >
      Subject requires nursing skill AND teaching relates directly to current
      illness/injury/functional loss, with new/changed needs (e.g., new wound/diagnosis/
      device) OR learner has not yet mastered the task and reinforcement is clinically
      indicated; visit notes describe content taught and learner response/progress.
    false_when: >
      Task already mastered, continued indefinitely without need, unrelated to the
      current condition, or can be safely provided by unskilled personnel.
  - name: "Medication Administration Need (§40.1.2.4A)"
    true_when: >
      ALL: (1) Route inherently requires a nurse (e.g., IV/IM/subcutaneous/
      hypodermoclysis) OR oral regimen is so complex that a nurse must monitor for
      adverse reactions; AND (2) no able/willing patient/caregiver can safely
      administer/monitor; AND (3) frequency/duration within standards or justified.
    false_when: >
      Limited to non-skilled tasks (prefilling syringes, routine eye drops/topicals),
      OR competent patient/caregiver can safely administer, OR frequency/duration
      outside standards without justification, OR order is specifically for daily
      insulin (flag for human review).
  - name: "Catheter Care Need (§40.1.2.7)"
    true_when: >
      ANY: insertion/sterile irrigation/replacement/management of urinary/suprapubic/
      urethral catheter using sterile technique; OR complications (blockage, UTI,
      leaking, skin breakdown) requiring skilled assessment/intervention; OR active
      teaching/re-teaching in progress. Frequency should match catheter type unless
      complications justify shorter intervals.
    false_when: >
      Purely routine care safely done by patient/caregiver without complications and
      no active teaching need; OR visit frequency exceeds norms without medical justification.
  - name: "Wound Care Need (§40.1.2.8)"
    true_when: >
      BOTH: (1) comprehensive wound assessment + practitioner order for active skilled
      treatment (e.g., sterile/complex dressings, NPWT, irrigation/packing, topical meds);
      AND (2) wound meets ≥1 qualifying complexity criterion (e.g., purulent/colored
      exudate, drain/T-tube, multilayer irrigation, recently debrided, stage III/IV or
      infected pressure ulcer, exposed muscle/bone, complex burn, post-op wound with
      complications).
    false_when: >
      Wound minor/stable and manageable by patient/caregiver; OR lacks qualifying
      complexity; OR no active skilled treatment order present.
  - name: "Ostomy Care Need (§40.1.2.9)"
    true_when: >
      ANY: immediate post-operative period after stoma creation/revision; OR complications
      (infection, peristomal skin breakdown, obstruction, prolapse, leakage, herniation)
      requiring skilled assessment/intervention; OR active teaching/re-teaching with goals
      not yet met and notes of response/deficits.
    false_when: >
      Routine pouch changes for a well-healed, uncomplicated ostomy with no active
      teaching need, safely done by patient/caregiver.
  - name: "Final Decision"
    approval_logic: >
      APPROVE if “Need for Skilled Nursing Care (General Requirement)” is TRUE AND
      ANY of the steps from “Meets Medicare 'Intermittent/Part-time' Definition”
      through “Ostomy Care Need (§40.1.2.9)” is TRUE.
    rejection_logic: >
      DENY if the above approval_logic is not satisfied.
    evidence_rule: >
      Compute from the eight preceding booleans. Evidence may be empty; the reason
      must name which steps triggered approval/denial.

final_instructions: |
  - Respond with ONLY one JSON object that matches response_schema and preserves the order in expected_order.
  - Keep reasons concise (≤ 60 words) and tie them to the quoted evidence.
  - For “Final Decision”, state the boolean and a reason like:
      "Need for Skilled Nursing TRUE and Wound Care TRUE → approval met" or
      "Need for Skilled Nursing FALSE → approval not met".
  - Temperature = 0; be strict and conservative.
