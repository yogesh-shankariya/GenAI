Here’s a cleaner, more polished rewrite of your text:

1. A total of 20 files were randomly selected, containing 71 questions each — resulting in approximately 1,420 questions used for testing.
2. Achieved 100% accuracy in guardrails detection.
3. Each answer was generated with evidence provided on the next line, except for guardrail cases and when information was not available in the context.
4. Successfully converted the raw output into structured JSON format, including title and page number as evidence for all questions.
5. Around 700 questions have been manually verified so far, with most aligning well with the context (verification is still in progress).
6. The average time to generate an answer across all 1,420 questions is 7 seconds. Please refer to the *Analysis* tab for detailed analysis.
7. The *conversation\_matrix* tab contains the output of each step along with time consumption details.

**Next Step:**
Currently in progress: Testing the chatbot on larger files, particularly those with context exceeding the model’s context window limit.

If you'd like, I can further shorten or reformat this for a report or presentation—let me know!
