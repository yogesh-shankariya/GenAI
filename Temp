**Subject:** Request for Cost Center to Enable Horizon API for TMV Chatbot

Hi Joe,

We’ve developed the TMV Chatbot using a local setup and OpenAI’s API. However, the current API access has expired, and to keep the chatbot running smoothly, we need to switch to Horizon API.

To do this, we’ll need access to three specific services in Horizon:

1. Embedding
2. Document
3. Search

For us to proceed, could you please share the cost center details so we can enable access to Horizon API for the TMV Chatbot?

Let me know if you need any additional information.

Thanks,
Yogesh Shankariya
