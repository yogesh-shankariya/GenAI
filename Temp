**Subject:** Approval Request for FFZ Layer Implementation in Hybrid MRR Chatbot

Hello Team,

Currently, the Hybrid MRR Chatbot downloads content for each question in every session, which results in increased latency, as the content is fetched repeatedly and then combined to generate a response.

To address this, we propose implementing a caching mechanism at the FFZ layer that stores the context per session. With this approach, the content will be downloaded and combined only once per session, and subsequent questions can retrieve the context directly from the FFZ layer, significantly improving performance.

Kindly request your approval to proceed with the implementation of the FFZ layer.

Best Regards,
