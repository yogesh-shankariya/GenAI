Subject: Clarification on PHI/PII Access and Embedding API

Hi Zack,

The current API access you have provided comes with the condition that we cannot use PHI/PII data, as you've mentioned the PHI/PII approval is still pending. During our conversation on July 14th, you indicated that the PHI/PII approval would be granted soon, and advised us to redact sensitive information in the interim.

However, our chatbot is fundamentally designed to work with patient medication details and medical chart data, both of which inherently include PHI. Redacting this information isn't feasible as it forms the core of our chatbot's functionality.

Could you please clarify if there is a specific reason you prefer providing access only to the Ingestion API instead of enabling us to use the Embedding API?

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,
\[Your Name]
