Hello Team,

Currently, for every session, the Hybrid MRR Chatbot downloads the patientâ€™s encounter information one record at a time for each question, combines the context, and then sends it to the Horizon API along with the question to generate a response. This repeated downloading and merging of context for every single question introduces significant latency.

To resolve this issue, we would like to evaluate the use of a caching mechanism through the FFZ layer. The idea is to cache the fully combined context at the beginning of each session in the FFZ layer. For all subsequent questions within that session, the chatbot can retrieve the context directly from the FFZ layer, thereby significantly reducing latency and improving overall performance.

Kindly request your approval to proceed with this enhancement.
