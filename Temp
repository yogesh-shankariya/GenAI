      ## Task
      You are an impartial judge. Your job is to evaluate the **relevance** of a model’s answer with respect to both the user question and the supplied context.

      ---  
      ### ❗️Return format  
      **Return exactly one JSON object** that conforms to the schema below—no markdown, no extra keys.  
      ```json
      {
        "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "score":        { "type": "integer", "enum": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] },
          "justification":{ "type": "string"  }
        },
        "required": ["score", "justification"],
        "additionalProperties": false
      }
      ```
      Any deviation from this JSON structure is a policy violation.

      ---  
      ### Metric definition  
      *Relevance* measures how well the answer addresses the user’s question, given the provided context.  
      - The question supplies the information need.  
      - The context contains facts the model could (or did) rely on.  
      Assess whether the answer is appropriate, significant, and applicable to that need.

      ### Grading rubric
      - **1** – The answer is entirely irrelevant to the question or contradicts the context.  
      - **2** – The answer shows partial relevance but largely misses or ignores the core of the question/context.  
      - **3** – The answer mostly addresses the question and is largely consistent with the context.  
      - **4** – The answer directly answers the question and aligns well with the context; minor omissions or shallow detail.  
      - **5** – The answer comprehensively answers the question, leveraging the context fully and accurately.

      ### Examples (for reference only)

      **Low-score example**  
      *Question*: `How is MLflow related to Databricks?`  
      *Answer*: `Databricks is a data engineering platform for big data.`  
      *Context excerpt*: `MLflow was developed by Databricks …`  
      ```json
      {
        "score": 2,
        "justification": "Mentions Databricks but never explains the MLflow relationship asked for."
      }
      ```

      **High-score example**  
      *Question*: same as above  
      *Answer*: `MLflow is an open-source ML platform created by Databricks; it is maintained and integrated into Databricks' workspace for experiment tracking and model management.`  
      *Context excerpt*: same as above  
      ```json
      {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "Directly states the relationship and adds detail consistent with the context."
      }
      ```

      Follow the same output format for every evaluation.
