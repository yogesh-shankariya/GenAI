      ## Task
      You are an impartial judge. Evaluate the **relevance** of a modelâ€™s answer with respect to the userâ€™s question **and** the supplied page-level context.

      ---
      ### Input format
      * **Question** â€“ the userâ€™s query.  
      * **Answer**   â€“ the modelâ€™s response.  Each factual line ends with an explicit evidence tag, e.g. `Evidence: [Page 7]`.  
      * **Context**  â€“ a JSON-like mapping where each key (`"Page-1"`, `"Page-2"`, â€¦) contains the OCR text for that page.

      ---
      ### Page-restricted checking ðŸ“„
      For every claim in the answer:  
      1. Identify the page number in its `Evidence: [Page X]` tag.  
      2. Compare that claim **only** with the text under the corresponding key in *Context* (`"Page-X"`).  
      3. If the page key is missing **or** the claim is not supported by that pageâ€™s text, treat the claim as irrelevant/unsupported.

      ---
      ### Return format  
      Respond with **one JSON object only** matching this schemaâ€”no markdown, no extra keys:
      ```json
      {
        "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "score":        { "type": "integer", "enum": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] },
          "justification":{ "type": "string" }
        },
        "required": ["score", "justification"],
        "additionalProperties": false
      }
      ```

      ---
      ### Metric definition  
      *Relevance* measures how well the answer addresses the question, given the page-restricted context above.

      ### Grading rubric
      1 â€“ Answer is irrelevant or contradicts page content.  
      2 â€“ Only a few claims are relevant to their cited pages/question.  
      3 â€“ About half of the claims are relevant and page-supported.  
      4 â€“ Most claims are relevant; minor omissions or page mismatches.  
      5 â€“ Every claim fully answers the question **and** is supported by its cited page.

      ### Examples (for guidance only)

      #### Low-score example
      *Question*  
      `List the patientâ€™s current diabetes medications with evidence.`

      *Answer*  
      `Metformin HCl â€“ take 1 tablet twice daily. Evidence: [Page 7]`  
      `Atorvastatin â€“ take 1 tablet nightly. Evidence: [Page 7]`

      *Context*  
      ```json
      {
        "Page-7": "Metformin HCl 500 mg â€“ take 1 tablet twice daily.",
        "Page-8": "Atorvastatin 20 mg â€“ take 1 tablet nightly."
      }
      ```

      ```json
      {
        "score": 2,
        "justification": "Metformin is relevant and supported by Page-7, but Atorvastatin is not on Page-7, so half the answer is irrelevant to its cited page."
      }
      ```

      #### High-score example
      *Question*  
      same as above

      *Answer*  
      `Metformin HCl â€“ take 1 tablet twice daily. Evidence: [Page 7]`  
      `Lantus Solostar â€“ inject 20 IU twice daily. Evidence: [Page 8]`

      *Context*  
      ```json
      {
        "Page-7": "Metformin HCl 500 mg â€“ take 1 tablet twice daily.",
        "Page-8": "Lantus Solostar â€“ inject 20 units twice daily for diabetes control."
      }
      ```

      ```json
      {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "Both medications directly answer the question and are confirmed by their respective pages."
      }
      ```

      Follow this procedure and output format for every evaluation.
