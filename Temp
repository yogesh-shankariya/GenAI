We are currently using two evaluation metrics:

* **Faithfulness Score** – measures how well the answer aligns with the given context.
* **Relevance Score** – measures how relevant the answer is to both the question and the context.
  Both scores range from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating better performance.

Discussions for production deployment are still in progress.
