Developed an urgency and appeal detection module using a keyword-first approach. The solution first identifies urgency and appeal indicators using a combination of RapidFuzz and spaCy, enabling large documents to be filtered down to only the most relevant pages and significantly reducing noise from irrelevant content. The filtered pages are then passed to an LLM to validate and confirm whether the content truly reflects urgency or appeal, which reduces unnecessary chunk processing and overall cost. Finally, I integrated the module with document metadata and successfully deployed the end-to-end capability to production.
