*If the answer is derived from multiple pages and the information cannot be split across individual answers per page, then provide the evidence in the following format:
# Evidence: [Page N1], [Page N2], etc.

Example:  
Question: How many encounter visits are there in the patient's chart?  
Answer: There are two encounter visits available.  
Evidence: [Page 2], [Page 24]  
(Note: Since the answer cannot be separated page-wise, you are allowed to list multiple pages as evidence.)
