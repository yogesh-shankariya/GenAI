EvaluationMetric(name=faithfulness, greater_is_better=True, long_name=faithfulness, version=v1, metric_details=
Task:
You must return the following fields in your response in two lines, one below the other:
score: Your numerical score for the model's faithfulness based on the rubric
justification: Your reasoning about the model's faithfulness score

You are an impartial judge. You will be given an input that was sent to a machine
learning model, and you will be given an output that the model produced. You
may also be given additional information that was used by the model to generate the output.

Your task is to determine a numerical score called faithfulness based on the input and output.
A definition of faithfulness and a grading rubric are provided below.
You must use the grading rubric to determine your score. You must also justify your score.

Examples could be included below for reference. Make sure to use them as references and to
understand them before completing the task.

Input:
{input}

Output:
{output}

{grading_context_columns}

Metric definition:
Faithfulness is only evaluated with the provided output and provided context, please ignore the provided input entirely when scoring faithfulness. Faithfulness assesses how much of the provided output is factually consistent with the provided context. A higher score indicates that a higher proportion of claims present in the output can be derived from the provided context. Faithfulness does not consider how much extra information from the context is not present in the output.

Grading rubric:
Faithfulness: Below are the details for different scores:
- Score 1: None of the claims in the output can be inferred from the provided context.
- Score 2: Some of the claims in the output can be inferred from the provided context, but the majority of the output is missing from, inconsistent with, or contradictory to the provided context.
- Score 3: Half or more of the claims in the output can be inferred from the provided context.
- Score 4: Most of the claims in the output can be inferred from the provided context, with very little information that is not directly supported by the provided context.
- Score 5: All of the claims in the output are directly supported by the provided context, demonstrating high faithfulness to the provided context.

Examples:

Example Output:
mlflow.autolog(disable=True) will disable autologging for all functions. In Databricks, autologging is enabled by default. 

Additional information used by the model:
key: context
value:
mlflow.autolog(log_input_examples: bool = False, log_model_signatures: bool = True, log_models: bool = True, log_datasets: bool = True, disable: bool = False, exclusive: bool = False, disable_for_unsupported_versions: bool = False, silent: bool = False, extra_tags: Optional[Dict[str, str]] = None) → None[source] Enables (or disables) and configures autologging for all supported integrations. The parameters are passed to any autologging integrations that support them. See the tracking docs for a list of supported autologging integrations. Note that framework-specific configurations set at any point will take precedence over any configurations set by this function.

Example score: 2
Example justification: The output provides a working solution, using the mlflow.autolog() function that is provided in the context.
        

Example Output:
mlflow.autolog(disable=True) will disable autologging for all functions.

Example score: 5
Example justification: The output provides a solution that is using the mlflow.autolog() function that is provided in the context.

Task:
You must return the following fields in your response in two lines, one below the other:
score: Your numerical score for the model's relevance based on the rubric
justification: Your reasoning about the model's relevance score

You are an impartial judge. You will be given an input that was sent to a machine
learning model, and you will be given an output that the model produced. You
may also be given additional information that was used by the model to generate the output.

Your task is to determine a numerical score called relevance based on the input and output.
A definition of relevance and a grading rubric are provided below.
You must use the grading rubric to determine your score. You must also justify your score.

Examples could be included below for reference. Make sure to use them as references and to
understand them before completing the task.

Input:
{input}

Output:
{output}

{grading_context_columns}

Metric definition:
Relevance encompasses the appropriateness, significance, and applicability of the output with respect to both the input and context. Scores should reflect the extent to which the output directly addresses the question provided in the input, given the provided context.

Grading rubric:
Relevance: Below are the details for different scores:- Score 1: The output doesn't mention anything about the question or is completely irrelevant to the provided context.
- Score 2: The output provides some relevance to the question and is somehow related to the provided context.
- Score 3: The output mostly answers the question and is largely consistent with the provided context.
- Score 4: The output answers the question and is consistent with the provided context.
- Score 5: The output answers the question comprehensively using the provided context.

Examples:

Example Input:
How is MLflow related to Databricks?

Example Output:
Databricks is a data engineering and analytics platform designed to help organizations process and analyze large amounts of data. Databricks is a company specializing in big data and machine learning solutions.

Additional information used by the model:
key: context
value:
MLflow is an open-source platform for managing the end-to-end machine learning (ML) lifecycle. It was developed by Databricks, a company that specializes in big data and machine learning solutions. MLflow is designed to address the challenges that data scientists and machine learning engineers face when developing, training, and deploying machine learning models.

Example score: 2
Example justification: The output provides relevant information about Databricks, mentioning it as a company specializing in big data and machine learning solutions. However, it doesn't directly address how MLflow is related to Databricks, which is the specific question asked in the input. Therefore, the output is only somewhat related to the provided context.
        

Example Input:
How is MLflow related to Databricks?

Example Output:
MLflow is a product created by Databricks to enhance the efficiency of machine learning processes.

Additional information used by the model:
key: context
value:
MLflow is an open-source platform for managing the end-to-end machine learning (ML) lifecycle. It was developed by Databricks, a company that specializes in big data and machine learning solutions. MLflow is designed to address the challenges that data scientists and machine learning engineers face when developing, training, and deploying machine learning models.

Example score: 4
Example justification: The output provides a relevant and accurate statement about the relationship between MLflow and Databricks. While it doesn't provide extensive detail, it still offers a substantial and meaningful response. To achieve a score of 5, the response could be further improved by providing additional context or details about how MLflow specifically functions within the Databricks ecosystem.
