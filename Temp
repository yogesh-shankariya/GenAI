Subject: Request for Extension of Work-from-Home Arrangement

Hello Team,

Thank you for approving my previous work-from-home request.

I would like to request an extension of this arrangement due to my father’s ongoing health condition. As shared earlier, both of his kidneys are not functioning, and his name has been registered on the kidney donor list. His treatment is currently being done at Civil Hospital in Gujarat and, given his condition and registration status, we are not in a position to relocate.

During dialysis or related treatment, there are times when he may suddenly have low sugar levels or a drop in blood pressure and needs to be admitted to the hospital urgently. As I am the only son, my presence is very important in case of such emergencies.

I assure you that extending my work-from-home arrangement will not impact my performance. I have been consistently meeting my deliverables and, as reflected in my recent snapshot, I am among the top performers in my team. You may also reach out to my manager for any further clarification regarding my performance.

I kindly request you to consider granting an extension of my work-from-home arrangement (for example, until [insert date] or as deemed appropriate).

Thank you for your understanding and support.

Regards,
Yogesh
