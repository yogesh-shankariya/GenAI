**Subject:** Request for Sample Code for "Structures" API under "Text" API

Dear Team,

I hope you're doing well.

I am currently working with the "Structures" API under the "Text" API to convert my output into a structured JSON format. However, I’ve been unable to locate any sample code for reference. I did attempt to create and run a sample on my own, but it did not work as expected.

Could you please share 2–3 example snippets demonstrating its usage? This would be greatly helpful.

Thank you in advance for your support.

Best regards,
Yogesh Shankariya
