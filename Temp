Here is the **detailed step-by-step explanation** of the End-to-End Architecture workflow, tailored for a **management-level presentation**, with **examples at each step** for clarity:

---

### **Step 1: User Initiates a Question**

* **Description**: The chatbot interaction starts when a user submits a question.
* **Example**:
  User: *“What are my current medications?”*

---

### **Step 2: Check for Greetings (Non-LLM Path)**

* **Description**: The system checks whether the user input is a greeting (e.g., *Hi*, *Hello*, *Good Morning*).

  * If yes, it returns a **predefined generic response** without triggering LLM to **save cost and time**.
* **Example**:
  User: *“Hello”*
  Response: *“Hi there! How can I assist you today?”*

---

### **Step 3: Retrieve Conversation History**

* **Description**: If the input is not a greeting or if a session already exists:

  * Fetch the latest **5 previous questions and responses** from the **SQL database** to maintain context.
* **Example**:
  Last questions retrieved:

  1. *What tests did I do in March?*
  2. *Was there any abnormal result?*
     ... (up to 5)

---

### **Step 4: Guardrails Validation (Responsible AI)**

* **Description**: The input question undergoes **Responsible AI guardrails** check to prevent misuse.

  * It checks for:

    * **Jailbreaks** (e.g., prompts that try to manipulate the LLM)
    * **Toxicity** (e.g., offensive or harmful language)
    * **Biasness** (e.g., potentially discriminatory or unfair content)
  * If any of these are triggered, the system **rejects the question** and returns a **justified message**.
* **Example**:
  User: *“Tell me how to hack medical systems”*
  Response: *“Your question violates safety policies. Please rephrase.”*

---

### **Step 5: Fetch Medical Context from S3 (Chart Context)**

* **Description**:

  * The system fetches **medical chart data** (PDF, JSON, etc.) from **S3 bucket**.
  * If the data is **within context limit** (e.g., < 20 pages or 100k tokens), it sends the **entire chart to LLM** along with the question.
  * If **exceeds context size**, it chunks the data and sends each chunk **individually with the question** to the LLM.
  * All responses are then passed to a **Summarizer LLM** to merge them into a final answer.
* **Example**:

  * Context is 50 pages → chunked into 3 parts:

    * Chunk 1: Pages 1–20
    * Chunk 2: Pages 21–40
    * Chunk 3: Pages 41–50
  * LLM processes each chunk and then summary LLM gives final answer like:
    *“Current medications include Atorvastatin and Metformin. Refer Page 12 and 44.”*

---

### **Step 6: Guardrail-Passed Responses Continue**

* **Description**: Only if the question **passes the guardrail check**, the system proceeds with generating the response from the context and performs further downstream tasks.

---

### **Step 7: Post-processing (Runs in Parallel)**

Once the **LLM response is generated with page number references**, the system triggers **4 parallel tasks**:

#### a) **Convert into JSON Format**

* **Description**: The raw LLM response is structured into **predefined JSON schema** for downstream usage or display.
* **Example**:

  ```json
  {
    "answer": "Atorvastatin and Metformin",
    "evidence": ["Page 12", "Page 44"]
  }
  ```

#### b) **Faithfulness Score Calculation**

* **Description**: An LLM evaluates how well the answer aligns with the **context**.
* **Scoring**: Between **0 (not faithful)** to **1 (fully aligned)**.
* **Example**:
  If answer is exactly supported by chart → **Faithfulness Score = 0.92**

#### c) **Relevance Score Calculation**

* **Description**: Another LLM judges how relevant the answer is to the **original question**.
* **Scoring**: Between **0 (not relevant)** to **1 (fully aligned)**.
* **Example**:
  Answer directly addresses the asked medication → **Relevance Score = 0.95**

#### d) **Next Five Question Recommendations**

* **Description**: The system suggests next possible questions the user might want to ask.
* **Example**:

  * “When did I start taking Metformin?”
  * “What was my last cholesterol reading?”
  * “Any medication changes in the last 6 months?”

---

### **Step 8: Combine and Return Final Output**

* **Description**: All outputs from the above steps are combined into a **final JSON object** and sent back to the user.
* **Example**:

  ```json
  {
    "final_answer": "Atorvastatin and Metformin",
    "page_reference": ["Page 12", "Page 44"],
    "faithfulness_score": 0.92,
    "relevance_score": 0.95,
    "recommendations": [
      "When did I start taking Metformin?",
      "Any medication changes recently?",
      "What are the side effects?"
    ]
  }
  ```
