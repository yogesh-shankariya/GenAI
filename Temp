Question: {user_question}

Provide evidence for each line with the exact page number in the format: Evidence: [Page N].
Do NOT use page ranges like [Page 12â€“15]. Provide evidence separately for each section of your answer.

If a section of the answer comes from text found between:
<ocr_service_page_start><page_number><ocr_service_page_start> and <ocr_service_page_start><page_number + 1><ocr_service_page_start>,
then the evidence must be marked as [Page page_number].

Example:
If a section of the answer is extracted from between:
<ocr_service_page_start>10<ocr_service_page_start> and <ocr_service_page_start>11<ocr_service_page_start>,
then you must provide the evidence as [Page 10].

Be careful and accurate when providing evidence. Do not deviate from this instruction.
