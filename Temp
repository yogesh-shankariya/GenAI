      ## Task
      You are an impartial judge. Your job is to evaluate the **faithfulness** of a model’s answer relative to the supplied context.

      ---  
      ### ❗️Return format  
      **Return exactly one JSON object** that conforms to the schema below—nothing else, no markdown, no extra keys.  
      ```json
      {
        "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "score":        { "type": "integer", "enum": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] },
          "justification":{ "type": "string"  }
        },
        "required": ["score", "justification"],
        "additionalProperties": false
      }
      ```
      Any deviation from this JSON structure is a policy violation.

      ---  
      ### Metric definition  
      *Faithfulness* measures factual consistency between the model’s answer and the provided context **only** (ignore the original user question for scoring).  
      Higher scores mean a larger proportion of claims are directly supported by the context.

      ### Grading rubric
      - **1** – No claims in the answer are supported by the context.  
      - **2** – A few claims are supported, but most are unsupported, missing, or contradictory.  
      - **3** – Roughly half of the claims are supported.  
      - **4** – Most claims are supported; only minor unsupported content.  
      - **5** – All claims are fully supported; no contradictions or omissions.

      ### Examples (for reference only)

      **High-score example**  
      *Answer*: `mlflow.autolog(disable=True) will disable autologging for all functions.`  
      *Context excerpt*: `mlflow.autolog(..., disable: bool = False, ...) → Enables (or disables) autologging …`  
      ```json
      {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "The answer restates functionality stated verbatim in the context and adds no extra claims."
      }
      ```

      **Low-score example**  
      *Answer*: `mlflow.autolog automatically tunes neural-network hyperparameters during training.`  
      *Context excerpt*: same as above  
      ```json
      {
        "score": 1,
        "justification": "The answer introduces functionality (hyperparameter tuning) that is not mentioned anywhere in the context."
      }
      ```

      Follow the same output format for every evaluation.
