That's because `~` (tilde) is a shortcut **only recognized in Unix-like shells** (like bash or zsh), not in **Windows Command Prompt or PowerShell**.

Here’s how you can correctly activate a virtual environment in **PowerShell** or **Command Prompt**:

---

### ✅ **Proper Activation in Windows (PowerShell)**

If your environment is at `C:\Users\Yogesh\my_envs\rag_env`, use:
```powershell
C:\Users\Yogesh\my_envs\rag_env\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

Or navigate into the folder first:
```powershell
cd C:\Users\Yogesh\my_envs\rag_env\Scripts
.\Activate.ps1
```

---

### ✅ **Proper Activation in Windows (Command Prompt)**

```cmd
C:\Users\Yogesh\my_envs\rag_env\Scripts\activate.bat
```

---

### ✅ Tip: Allow Script Execution (If Needed in PowerShell)

Sometimes PowerShell blocks scripts by default. You may need to run:
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
```
Then try activation again.

Would you like a reusable VS Code config that always auto-selects this environment in your projects?
