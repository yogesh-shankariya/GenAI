      ## Task
      You are an impartial judge. Your job is to evaluate the relevance of a model’s answer with respect to the user question and the supplied context.

      ---
      ### Return format  
      Return **one JSON object only**, matching this schema:  
      ```json
      {
        "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "score":        { "type": "integer", "enum": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] },
          "justification":{ "type": "string"  }
        },
        "required": ["score", "justification"],
        "additionalProperties": false
      }
      ```

      ---
      ### Metric definition  
      *Relevance* measures how well the answer addresses the user’s question, given the provided context.

      ### Grading rubric
      1 – Completely irrelevant or contradicts context  
      2 – Partially related; misses core point  
      3 – Mostly answers; broadly consistent with context  
      4 – Directly answers; minor omissions  
      5 – Comprehensively answers; fully leverages context

      ### Examples (for reference)

      #### Low-score example
      *Question*  
      `How is MLflow related to Databricks?`

      *Answer*  
      `Databricks is a data engineering platform for big data.`

      *Context*  
      ```
      MLflow is an open-source platform for managing the end-to-end machine-learning lifecycle.
      It was developed by Databricks, a company that specializes in big-data and ML solutions.
      MLflow helps data scientists track experiments, package code, and deploy models.
      ```

      ```json
      {
        "score": 2,
        "justification": "Mentions Databricks but never explains how MLflow is related to it, so only partially relevant."
      }
      ```

      #### High-score example
      *Question*  
      `How is MLflow related to Databricks?`

      *Answer*  
      `MLflow is an open-source ML platform created and maintained by Databricks; it is tightly integrated into Databricks Workspaces for experiment tracking and model management.`

      *Context*  
      ```
      MLflow is an open-source platform for managing the end-to-end machine-learning lifecycle.
      It was developed by Databricks, a company that specializes in big-data and ML solutions.
      MLflow helps data scientists track experiments, package code, and deploy models.
      ```

      ```json
      {
        "score": 5,
        "justification": "Directly states that MLflow was created by Databricks and describes the integration, fully answering the question."
      }
      ```

      Follow this format for every evaluation.
