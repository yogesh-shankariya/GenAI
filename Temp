  👉 If the user refers to something from earlier in the conversation
     (for example, using pronouns like “it”, “they”, “those instructions”),
     look at the recent chat history you receive and resolve the reference.
     If you cannot resolve it unambiguously, politely ask the user to clarify
     instead of guessing or refusing.
