**Slide 1: Three-layer flow (Agents → Algorithms → Applications)**

* Goal: convert raw healthcare data into usable member-level actions
* Flow: data comes from Agents, gets processed by Algorithms, and is finally consumed by Applications/use cases
* Output: standardized data (FHIR) + events/insights that power multiple apps

**Slide 2: Layer 1 — Agents (Blue) | Data sources**

* Provider health systems (EMR vendor solutions) send clinical events and records
* Third-party health apps / tech vendors contribute additional member and clinical context
* QHIN / QHIO networks exchange data across organizations (interoperability)

**Slide 3: Layer 2 — Algorithms/Services | Processing layer**

* Clinical Data Exchange (FHIR Server + Interop API)

  * converts incoming data into a standard format (FHIR)
  * makes data accessible via APIs
* ADT Broadcaster

  * detects admit/discharge/transfer events and triggers notifications
* Care Gap Closure (or Prior Auth / Chart Chase Hub, based on use case)

  * identifies missing actions, gaps, or next steps and creates insights

**Slide 4: Layer 3 — Applications/Use Cases (Green) | What users see**

* Total Member View

  * shows a 360° view of member data and history in one place
* Registration & Self-Service

  * enables providers/payers to register and manage member-related data
* Coordination Hub (HealthOS Portal)

  * supports secure handoffs, referrals, and workflow coordination between entities

**Slide 5: End-to-end example (simple scenario)**

* Step 1 (Agent): Member gets admitted in a hospital → EMR creates an admission record
* Step 2 (Algorithm): Clinical Data Exchange converts it to FHIR → ADT Broadcaster flags it as an admission event
* Step 3 (Application):

  * Coordination Hub gets an alert → care team starts follow-up workflow
  * Total Member View updates member status and recent encounter details
  * Registration & Self-Service can update demographics/coverage, which flows back into the exchange

**Slide 6: Why this design helps (value points)**

* Standardizes data across many sources using FHIR
* Enables faster decisions using events (ADT) and insights (care gaps)
* Multiple apps can reuse the same processed data instead of building separate integrations
* Supports scalable onboarding of new sources and new use cases with minimal change

If you want, I can rewrite these as shorter 1-line bullets (more PPT-friendly) or align the algorithm names exactly to the ones you want from the image (e.g., Prior Auth, ER Redirection, Chart Chase Hub).
