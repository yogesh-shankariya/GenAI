Built an urgency/appeal detection module using RapidFuzz + spaCy to identify keywords and filter large documents to only relevant pages, reducing noise. Sent only filtered pages to an LLM for final validation, cutting unnecessary chunks and cost. Integrated with document metadata and successfully deployed to production.
